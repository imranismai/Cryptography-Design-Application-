Computer Security Assignment - Custom Ciphers

This repository contains the Python source code for the "Cryptography Design & Application" assignment (September 2025).

Ciphers Implemented

Stream Cipher: vortex_stream_cipher.py (Named: VorTexStreamCipher)

Block Cipher: sbc_block_cipher.py (Named: IronClaDBlockCipher)

How to Run

Each file is a self-contained Python program that includes its own interactive demo.

1. Run the Stream Cipher (VorTexStreamCipher)

Navigate to the directory and run:

python vortex_stream_cipher.py


(If the command above doesn't work, you may need to use python3)

python3 vortex_stream_cipher.py


2. Run the Block Cipher (IronClaDBlockCipher)

Navigate to the directory and run:

python sbc_block_cipher.py


(If the command above doesn't work, you may need to use python3)

python3 sbc_block_cipher.py
