Computer Security Assignment - Custom Ciphers

This repository contains the Python source code for the "Cryptography Design & Application" assignment (September 2025).

Ciphers Implemented

Stream Cipher: VorTexStream.py

Block Cipher: IronClaDBlock.py

How to Run

Each file is a self-contained Python program that includes its own interactive demo.

1. Run the Stream Cipher (VorTexStream)

Navigate to the directory and run:

python VorTexStream.py


(If the command above doesn't work, you may need to use python3)

python3 VorTexStream.py


2. Run the Block Cipher (IronClaDBlockCipher)

Navigate to the directory and run:

python IronClaDBlock.py


(If the command above doesn't work, you may need to use python3)

python3 IronClaDBlock.py
